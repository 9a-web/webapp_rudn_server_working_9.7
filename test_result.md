# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

This prevents React app from loading entirely. ANALYSIS OF CODE IMPLEMENTATION: ✅ i18n configuration appears correct in /app/frontend/src/i18n/config.js with proper Russian/English translations ✅ MenuModal.jsx implements language switching with toggleLanguage() function that changes i18n.language between 'ru' and 'en' ✅ Language button shows current language (RU/EN) and is enabled (disabled: false) ✅ Translation files contain all required UI text mappings ✅ index.js imports i18n config before App ✅ Backend URL correctly set to http://localhost:8001 in .env file. CRITICAL ISSUE: Browser automation tool URL routing malfunction prevents verification of actual functionality. React app shows only 404 error from backend instead of loading frontend. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must investigate and fix browser automation URL routing issue before language switching can be properly tested."

          comment: "🔧 Fixed analytics counting logic. Previously, each class (discipline) was counted separately even if multiple classes occurred at the same time. Now groups classes by time slot (e.g., 10:30-11:50). Frontend (App.js): Modified trackScheduleView() to count unique time slots using Set data structure. Calculates uniqueTimeSlots.size and passes as classes_count in metadata. Backend (achievements.py): Updated view_schedule action handler to accept classes_count from metadata and increment schedule_views by that amount (defaults to 1 for backwards compatibility). Example: If 3 subjects occur at 10:30-11:50, counts as 1 class instead of 3. Backend auto-reloaded. Ready for testing."

          comment: "✅ Analytics counting fix successfully verified. Created comprehensive test with telegram_id 999888777: 1) Created test user and got initial stats (schedule_views: 0) 2) Simulated viewing schedule with 5 classes - correctly incremented by 5 (schedule_views: 5) 3) Simulated viewing schedule with 3 classes - correctly incremented by 3 more (schedule_views: 8) 4) Tested backwards compatibility without metadata - correctly incremented by 1 (schedule_views: 9). Backend properly accepts classes_count from metadata and increments schedule_views by that amount instead of always by 1. Defaults to 1 when no metadata provided. All test scenarios passed - the fix is working correctly."

ROOT CAUSE: Функция groupTasksByDeadline() группировала задачи относительно текущего времени (now), а не относительно выбранной даты в селекторе (tasksSelectedDate). РЕШЕНИЕ: Переработана логика группировки задач. Теперь группировка происходит относительно выбранной даты. НОВЫЕ ПРАВИЛА: 1) Просроченные: deadline < selectedDateStart && deadline < now (показываются только когда действительно просрочены). 2) На выбранную дату: deadline в пределах выбранного дня (00:00-23:59). 3) На этой неделе: 0 < diffDays <= 7 от выбранной даты. 4) Позже: diffDays > 7. ДОПОЛНИТЕЛЬНО: Добавлена функция getTaskGroupTitle() для динамического заголовка группы: 'Сегодня' / 'Завтра' / 'Вчера' / 'На эту дату' в зависимости от выбранной даты.

Убери это') реализован Вариант 1 - упрощенная логика показа задач. ПРОБЛЕМА v2: Задачи с дедлайном на будущие даты показывались в разделе 'Позже', создавая путаницу. РЕШЕНИЕ v3: Кардинально упрощена логика. УБРАНО: Разделы 'Просроченные', 'На этой неделе', 'Позже' полностью удалены. ОСТАВЛЕНО: Только 2 раздела: 1) 'На выбранную дату' (заголовок динамический: Сегодня/Завтра/Вчера/На эту дату) - показываются только задачи с дедлайном строго на выбранную дату (00:00-23:59). 2) 'Без срока' - задачи без дедлайна (показываются всегда). ИЗМЕНЕНИЯ: TasksSection.jsx - функция groupTasksByDeadline() упрощена, теперь возвращает только {today, noDeadline}. Удалены все проверки на overdue, thisWeek, later. Убран рендеринг 4 лишних TaskGroup. ПРЕИМУЩЕСТВА: Нет путаницы - пользователь видит только задачи на конкретную дату. Простота - не нужно разбираться в множестве разделов. Фокус на выбранном дне.

ЛОГИКА: При загрузке страницы читается сохраненное значение (home/tasks/journal), если значения нет - используется 'home'. При переключении раздела значение автоматически сохраняется. РЕЗУЛЬТАТ: Пользователь остается на том же разделе при обновлении страницы (F5), не теряет контекст работы. Frontend скомпилирован успешно. Создана документация ACTIVE_TAB_PERSISTENCE.md."

      message: "🐛 FIX: Задачи не дублируются на разные дни. По запросу пользователя 'Есть проблема: задачи на один день переносятся и на другие дни' исправлена логика фильтрации. ПРОБЛЕМА: Задачи без дедлайна показывались на ВСЕХ днях в селекторе дат. РЕШЕНИЕ: Изменена функция getTasksForSelectedDate() в TasksSection.jsx. Добавлена проверка: задачи без дедлайна показываются ТОЛЬКО на сегодняшний день (selectedDateStart === todayStart). Задачи с дедлайном показываются только на ту дату, на которую установлен дедлайн. РЕЗУЛЬТАТ: Каждая задача привязана к своей дате и не дублируется на другие дни. Задачи без дедлайна видны только сегодня. Frontend скомпилирован успешно."

      message: "✅ ИСПРАВЛЕНИЯ СТАТИСТИКИ И МОБИЛЬНОЙ АДАПТАЦИИ: Выполнены 2 критических исправления по запросу пользователя. 1) СТАТИСТИКА: Исправлен подсчёт уникальных пар в расписании. ПРОБЛЕМА: пары считались только по времени без учёта дня недели (10:30-11:50 в понедельник и вторник = 1 пара вместо 2). РЕШЕНИЕ: изменён подсчёт на комбинацию день+время во всех местах (App.js trackScheduleView, analytics.js calculateScheduleStats и getClassTypeStats). Теперь используется уникальный ключ '${day}|${time}'. 2) ДОСТИЖЕНИЯ: Полностью переработана мобильная адаптация компонента AchievementNotification.jsx. Упрощена структура (убраны sm: брейкпоинты), унифицированы размеры (padding p-4, иконки 6x6/4x4/5x5), улучшена читаемость (увеличены шрифты, убрана обрезка текста), оптимизирована ширина (calc(100% - 24px)). Компонент теперь корректно отображается на экранах 320px-430px. Frontend скомпилирован успешно. Оба исправления готовы к тестированию."

      message: "🏆 НОВЫЕ ДОСТИЖЕНИЯ ЗА ИССЛЕДОВАНИЕ ПРИЛОЖЕНИЯ: Добавлено 9 новых достижений по запросу пользователя (все кроме Полиглот и Коллекционер). Backend: Расширена модель UserStats с 6 новыми полями отслеживания (analytics_views, calendar_opens, notifications_configured, schedule_shares, menu_items_visited, active_days). Список ACHIEVEMENTS увеличен с 6 до 15 достижений: Аналитик 📈 (10), Любитель графиков 📊 (15), Организатор 📅 (10), Мастер настроек ⚙️ (10), Делишься знаниями 🔗 (15), Амбассадор 🎤 (25), Исследователь 🔎 (20), Первая неделя 📆 (30), Перфекционист ✨ (50). Логика проверки достижений обновлена в check_and_award_achievements: поддержка проверки 7 дней подряд с анализом последовательности дат, подсчёт посещённых пунктов меню (4 требуется), проверка всех 14 базовых достижений для Перфекциониста. Функция track_user_action поддерживает 6 новых типов действий: view_analytics, open_calendar, configure_notifications, share_schedule, visit_menu_item (с menu_item в metadata), daily_activity (автоматическое отслеживание по датам YYYY-MM-DD). Frontend: Интеграция отслеживания в 5 компонентов. App.js: handleCalendarClick, handleAnalyticsClick, handleAchievementsClick, handleNotificationsClick отслеживают соответствующие действия с visit_menu_item. checkTimeBasedAchievements теперь отслеживает daily_activity для достижения 'Первая неделя'. NotificationSettings.jsx: handleSave отслеживает configure_notifications при включении уведомлений. ShareScheduleModal.jsx: handleShareToTelegram отслеживает share_schedule с метаданными. Backend restart успешен, frontend compiled successfully. Система готова награждать пользователей за активное исследование всех функций приложения!"

      message: "✅ ПЕРЕКЛЮЧЕНИЕ РАЗДЕЛОВ РЕАЛИЗОВАНО: Добавлена функциональность для средней кнопки в нижней навигации ('Список дел'). Созданы 2 новых компонента секций: 1) TasksSection.jsx - раздел 'Список дел' с желто-оранжевой темой (ClipboardList иконка, градиент from-yellow-400 to-orange-400). Содержит заголовок, описание и placeholder контент 'Раздел в разработке'. 2) JournalSection.jsx - раздел 'Журнал' с фиолетово-розовой темой (FileCheck иконка, градиент from-purple-400 to-pink-400). Содержит заголовок, описание и placeholder контент. App.js полностью переработан: добавлена условная отрисовка разделов через activeTab state. При activeTab='home': отображается полный главный экран (LiveScheduleCarousel, WeekDaySelector, LiveScheduleSection, DesktopSidebar). При activeTab='tasks': показывается только Header + TasksSection, весь контент главного экрана скрыт. При activeTab='journal': показывается только Header + JournalSection. Добавлен handleTabChange с haptic feedback='light' для улучшенного UX. Анимации переходов через Framer Motion: initial opacity=0/y=20, animate opacity=1/y=0, exit opacity=0/y=-20, duration 0.3s. Bottom Navigation работает корректно: все 3 кнопки переключают разделы, активная кнопка подсвечивается градиентом, плавные анимации. Протестировано: переключение между Home → Tasks → Journal → Home работает идеально, Header остается на месте, главный экран полностью скрывается при переходе на новые разделы.

      message: "🐛 BUG FIX - Логика показа раздела 'Просроченные': Исправлена проблема, когда вкладка 'Просроченные' появлялась при выборе всех дат в селекторе дней недели. ПРОБЛЕМА: Раздел 'Просроченные' отображался независимо от выбранной даты, что было логически неверно. АНАЛИЗ: Функция groupTasksByDeadline() группировала задачи относительно текущего времени (now), а не относительно выбранной даты в селекторе (tasksSelectedDate). РЕШЕНИЕ: Полностью переработана логика группировки задач в TasksSection.jsx. Теперь группировка происходит относительно выбранной даты: selectedDateStart (00:00) и selectedDateEnd (23:59). НОВЫЕ ПРАВИЛА ГРУППИРОВКИ: 1) Просроченные: deadline < selectedDateStart && deadline < now (показываются только когда действительно просрочены относительно выбранной даты и текущего момента). 2) На выбранную дату: deadline >= selectedDateStart && deadline <= selectedDateEnd (задачи в пределах выбранного дня). 3) На этой неделе: 0 < diffDays <= 7 от выбранной даты. 4) Позже: diffDays > 7. 5) Без срока: задачи без deadline. ДОПОЛНИТЕЛЬНО: Добавлена функция getTaskGroupTitle() для динамического заголовка: 'Сегодня' (если выбрана сегодняшняя дата), 'Завтра' (завтрашняя дата), 'Вчера' (вчерашняя дата), 'На эту дату' (любая другая дата). Заголовок группы меняется в зависимости от контекста. РЕЗУЛЬТАТ: Логика показа разделов стала контекстуальной и понятной пользователю. Frontend скомпилирован успешно.

Убери это') реализован Вариант 1 - кардинально упрощенная логика показа задач. ПРОБЛЕМА v2: Множество разделов (Просроченные, На этой неделе, Позже) создавали путаницу. Задачи с будущими дедлайнами показывались в 'Позже'. РЕШЕНИЕ v3: Оставлены только 2 раздела. ТЕПЕРЬ ПОКАЗЫВАЕТСЯ: 1) 'На выбранную дату' (с динамическим заголовком: Сегодня/Завтра/Вчера/На эту дату) - только задачи с дедлайном строго на выбранную дату (00:00-23:59). 2) 'Без срока' - задачи без дедлайна (показываются всегда для удобства). УДАЛЕНО: Разделы 'Просроченные', 'На этой неделе', 'Позже' полностью убраны. ИЗМЕНЕНИЯ КОДА: TasksSection.jsx - функция groupTasksByDeadline() упрощена с 70 строк до 30, возвращает только {today, noDeadline}. Удалены переменные overdue, thisWeek, later. Убраны 4 блока TaskGroup (оставлены только 2). Простая логика: if (deadline в пределах выбранного дня) → today, else if (!deadline) → noDeadline. ПРЕИМУЩЕСТВА: Максимальная простота и фокус. Пользователь видит только задачи на конкретную дату. Нет путаницы с множеством разделов. Задачи 'Без срока' всегда доступны. Frontend скомпилирован успешно.

      message: "🐛 ИСПРАВЛЕНИЕ БАГА: Дата создания задачи в 'Список дел'. ПРОБЛЕМА: При выборе даты в селекторе дней недели, новая задача создавалась на сегодняшний день вместо выбранной даты. ROOT CAUSE: В AddTaskModal не передавалась выбранная дата (tasksSelectedDate) из TasksSection, поэтому дедлайн задачи не устанавливался автоматически на выбранную дату. РЕШЕНИЕ: 1) TasksSection.jsx - добавлен проп selectedDate={tasksSelectedDate} в AddTaskModal (строка 829). 2) AddTaskModal.jsx - добавлен новый проп selectedDate с значением по умолчанию new Date(). 3) AddTaskModal.jsx - добавлен useEffect, который автоматически устанавливает deadline на выбранную дату при открытии модального окна. Время устанавливается на 23:59 (конец дня). Дата форматируется в формат YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM для input type='datetime-local'.
