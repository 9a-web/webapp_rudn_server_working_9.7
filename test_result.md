# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

This prevents React app from loading entirely. ANALYSIS OF CODE IMPLEMENTATION: ✅ i18n configuration appears correct in /app/frontend/src/i18n/config.js with proper Russian/English translations ✅ MenuModal.jsx implements language switching with toggleLanguage() function that changes i18n.language between 'ru' and 'en' ✅ Language button shows current language (RU/EN) and is enabled (disabled: false) ✅ Translation files contain all required UI text mappings ✅ index.js imports i18n config before App ✅ Backend URL correctly set to http://localhost:8001 in .env file. CRITICAL ISSUE: Browser automation tool URL routing malfunction prevents verification of actual functionality. React app shows only 404 error from backend instead of loading frontend. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must investigate and fix browser automation URL routing issue before language switching can be properly tested."

Now groups classes by time slot (e.g., 10:30-11:50). Frontend (App.js): Modified trackScheduleView() to count unique time slots using Set data structure. Calculates uniqueTimeSlots.size and passes as classes_count in metadata. Backend (achievements.py): Updated view_schedule action handler to accept classes_count from metadata and increment schedule_views by that amount (defaults to 1 for backwards compatibility). Example: If 3 subjects occur at 10:30-11:50, counts as 1 class instead of 3. Backend auto-reloaded. Ready for testing."

Created comprehensive test with telegram_id 999888777: 1) Created test user and got initial stats (schedule_views: 0) 2) Simulated viewing schedule with 5 classes - correctly incremented by 5 (schedule_views: 5) 3) Simulated viewing schedule with 3 classes - correctly incremented by 3 more (schedule_views: 8) 4) Tested backwards compatibility without metadata - correctly incremented by 1 (schedule_views: 9). Backend properly accepts classes_count from metadata and increments schedule_views by that amount instead of always by 1. Defaults to 1 when no metadata provided. All test scenarios passed - the fix is working correctly."

Backend: Расширена модель UserStats с 6 новыми полями отслеживания (analytics_views, calendar_opens, notifications_configured, schedule_shares, menu_items_visited, active_days). Список ACHIEVEMENTS увеличен с 6 до 15 достижений: Аналитик 📈 (10), Любитель графиков 📊 (15), Организатор 📅 (10), Мастер настроек ⚙️ (10), Делишься знаниями 🔗 (15), Амбассадор 🎤 (25), Исследователь 🔎 (20), Первая неделя 📆 (30), Перфекционист ✨ (50). Логика проверки достижений обновлена в check_and_award_achievements: поддержка проверки 7 дней подряд с анализом последовательности дат, подсчёт посещённых пунктов меню (4 требуется), проверка всех 14 базовых достижений для Перфекциониста. Функция track_user_action поддерживает 6 новых типов действий: view_analytics, open_calendar, configure_notifications, share_schedule, visit_menu_item (с menu_item в metadata), daily_activity (автоматическое отслеживание по датам YYYY-MM-DD). Frontend: Интеграция отслеживания в 5 компонентов. App.js: handleCalendarClick, handleAnalyticsClick, handleAchievementsClick, handleNotificationsClick отслеживают соответствующие действия с visit_menu_item. checkTimeBasedAchievements теперь отслеживает daily_activity для достижения 'Первая неделя'. NotificationSettings.jsx: handleSave отслеживает configure_notifications при включении уведомлений. ShareScheduleModal.jsx: handleShareToTelegram отслеживает share_schedule с метаданными. Backend restart успешен, frontend compiled successfully. Система готова награждать пользователей за активное исследование всех функций приложения!"
